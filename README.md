I would love to connect!

My goals

Everyone has a dream right? I definitely do! I want to have the life I never had, enjoying financial security and able to do all the enjoyable yet
educational things. Like for example traveling the world!
I want to see and learn all about the world around me and gain a greater understand of human history and culture. I find it extremely beautiful. 
I dream of creating a legacy and environment where I can truly express myself for who I truly am. I look forward to achieving all my dreams!

Another goal of mine is to bring to people the emotional healing that we all need. When you are less fortunate in life you often don't get the emotional help you need to deal with tramatic events in your past, maybe even from bad parenting. I would like to one day create a way to bring healing to people that can't afford it, because eveyone has a right to having good mental heath.

My motivations

What is it that motivates me? Love of course!
Love for my family, the people I care about and love for knowledge and understanding.
If there is one thing I can not get enough of it is venturing into the unknown, trying to learn or experience something new.
And lastly self love! I have always put others first in my younger years, and this time, I finally want to focus on fulfilling my dreams.
And no matter how fast those shooting stars flash across the sky, I will catch each and every one of them!

Thank you for reading!
