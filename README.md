I am not a big social media person, but I would love to connect with any nice people out there!

My goals

Everyone has a dream right? I definitly do! I want to have the life I never had, enjoying finanial security and able to do all the enjoyable yet
educational things. Like for example traveling the world!
I want to see and learn all about the world around me and gain a greater undertsand of human history and culture. I find it extremely beautiful. 
I dream of creating a legacy and environment where I can truly express myself for who I truly am. I look forward to achieving all my dreams!

My motivations

What is it that motivates me? Love of course!
Love for my family, the people I care about and love for knowledge and understanding.
If there is one thing I can not get enough of it is venturing into the unknown, trying to learn or experience something new.
And lastly self love! I have always put others first in my younger years, and this time, I finally want to focus on fulfilling my dreams.
And no matter how fast those shooting stars flash across the sky, I will catch each and every one of them!
